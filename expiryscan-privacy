    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>December 1, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>ExpiryScan</strong> (“the App”) handles information
      when you use the application on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      ExpiryScan is a utility app that helps you scan and track expiry dates of products using
      your device’s camera. We designed the app so that it works <strong>locally on your device</strong>
      and does <strong>not require you to create an account</strong> or provide personal details.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
      ExpiryScan does <strong>not</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collect your name, email address, phone number, or other contact details.</li>
      <li>Collect your location (GPS or background location).</li>
      <li>Collect payment information.</li>
      <li>Track you across other apps or websites.</li>
      <li>Sell or share your data with third parties for advertising purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Camera and Image Processing</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses your device’s camera to capture images of product labels so that expiry dates
      can be detected.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Captured images are processed <strong>on your device</strong> to extract text (expiry dates).</li>
      <li>Images and recognized text are <strong>not uploaded</strong> to our servers.</li>
      <li>We do not run our own backend server for this functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In some cases, third-party libraries (for example, optical character recognition / OCR libraries)
      may be used solely to perform text recognition on the device. These libraries do not receive
      personally identifiable information from us.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Local Data and Reminders</h2>
    <p>
      When you save items and expiry dates, this information is stored locally on your device
      (for example, in local storage or a local database).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expiry items, dates, and related notes are stored only on your device.</li>
      <li>Notification reminders (for upcoming expiry dates) are scheduled from your device.</li>
      <li>We do not have access to this information and it is not automatically backed up to our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      The current version of ExpiryScan does <strong>not</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>show personalized advertising,</li>
      <li>use third-party analytics SDKs to track behavior, or</li>
      <li>share data with advertising networks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If this ever changes in a future version, this Privacy Policy and the Data Safety section
      on Google Play will be updated before such changes go live.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      ExpiryScan is designed for general audiences and is <strong>not directed at children under 13</strong>.
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has
      provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to remove such
      information if it is somehow stored.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      Because ExpiryScan primarily stores data locally on your device and does not transmit personal data
      to our own servers, the main security protections are provided by your device’s operating system
      (screen lock, device encryption, etc.). We recommend keeping your device’s software up to date and
      using a secure screen lock.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect improvements in the App or changes
      in legal requirements. If we make significant changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at
      the top of this page. The latest version will always be available at this URL.
    </p>
